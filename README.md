So, come with us and together we'll explore some of the well known (and some of the lesser known) places of interest that helped sculpt the fabulous foursome in becoming the most decorated and idolised band the world has ever seen.

## UX 

This website has been developed for fans of the Beatles. A site to book sight-seeing tours in different locations across the globe delivered by experts and lifetime fans of the band. To experience first-hand the various locales, venues, lifestyles and important historical landmarks that influenced the bands success. 

### Strategy

The aim was to create a site with an exciting interface with exagerrated colour and psychedelic content to compliment one of the bands most iconic eras. Images, typography and styling has been presented to reinforce Beatles nostalgia. 

### Scope

For users, I provided a site that could captivate intrigue in order to sell sight-seeing tours providing interesting content on each of the band members and their lives. 

### Structure

Ease of use was important so a single page site was created with sectional content to scroll through. Each section is presented with intuitive presentation with clickable extensions to view more information on idividual content when desired. 

### Skeleton

The use of Balsamic wireframe mockups helped with the initial design and continued development of the site.
