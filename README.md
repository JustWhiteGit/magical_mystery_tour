# Magical Mystery Tours

So, you're a Beatles fan are you? You've got all the albums and love everything about them, I'm sure. But have you ever considered visiting some of the towns and cities that made them what they are today? You're probably curious as to where they first met, where they found love, where they called home? We have the answers! So, come with us and together we'll explore some of the well known (and some of the lesser known) places of interest that helped sculpt the fabulous foursome in becoming the most decorated and idolised band the world has ever seen.

## UX 

This website has been developed for fans of the Beatles. A site to book sight-seeing tours in different locations across the globe delivered by experts and lifetime fans of the band. To experience first-hand the various locales, venues, lifestyles and important historical landmarks that influenced the bands success. 

#### Strategy

The aim was to create a site with an exciting interface with exagerrated colour and psychedelic content to compliment one of the bands most iconic eras. Images, typography and styling has been presented to reinforce Beatles nostalgia. 

#### Scope

For users, I provided a site that could captivate intrigue in order to sell sight-seeing tours providing interesting content on each of the band members and their lives. 

#### Structure

Ease of use was important so a single page site was created with sectional content to scroll through. Each section is presented with intuitive presentation with clickable extensions to view more information on idividual content when desired. 

#### Skeleton

The use of Balsamic wireframe mockups helped with the initial design and continued development of the site.

#### Surface

Presented with eye-catching colours and bold typography applicable to the band genre. 

## Features 

#### Implemented
* Presented with full title screen home page and a single menu toggle to find each section. Whereas for desktop/large screen viewports an expanded centralised menu to navigate the site which remains fixed for user transparency. 

* Smooth scroll configuration provides clean transition from section to section in both mobile and desktop display. This allows the viewport to display each section independantly and snaps back to the relevent section with the most content in the users viewport display. 

* Factual biopics of each band member is displayed with a corresponding silhouette image to contrast with the busy multicoloured backdrops. Each member has expandable content available for the user to toggle. 

* Tour packages presented cleanly with contrasting simplicity against the bold background, maintaining consistant user experience. Each tour has more content available that can be switched on/off with the use of more info buttons.

* The contact us section provides a simple form structure with free-text space and selectable drop-down options. This area also provides usable links to social media sites within a new tab, to further improve user experience. 

* Due to the visually stimulating style of the site, scroll bars have been removed to reduce unnecessary visual noise. The use of the fixed menu bar and smooth scrolling pages provides ample options for navigation. 

#### Future release
* Interactive Google map interface with highlighted areas of interest in conjunction with the available tour packages. 

* Enriched testamonial section for further user reviews.

* Gallery with tour images/fan's photos.
