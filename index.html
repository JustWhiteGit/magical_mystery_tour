								<p class="text-justify card-text"> For rags-to-riches stories, Ringo’s has to be up
									there with the greats. Born Richard Starkey his upbringing on one of Liverpool’s
									harshest housing estates meant his childhood was tough. Ringo was a poorly child and
									spent most of his time in hospital, missing out on a decent education. </p>

									<div class="card card-body-starr">
										<p> During one of his long stints in hospital he was handed a set of drumsticks.
											These would be the tools to get him out of the bleak life that seemed set
											out in front of him. He was a late comer to the band but from the moment
											Ringo stepped behind the drums for the Beatles the slow but steady success
											they had been experiencing suddenly sky rocketed. Once the 4 puzzle pieces
											were in place the world that Ringo knew changed beyond all recognition and
											he never looked back. Let us take you back to his tiny first home, the pub
											that his mother worked in at the bottom of his road and onwards and upwards
											through to central London townhouse and his mansions in England’s most
											prestigious towns. A remarkable story of the lad from the Dingle. </p>
										<p><i>There is something for Ringo fans in all our tours however to really
											understand Ringo’s story we recommend our Liverpool package.</i></p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Day 1</p>

					<p> Our day starts with a morning of sightseeing on our
						psychedelic
						tour bus. Coach based with stops for photo opportunities at
						all
						of the points of interest:</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Menlove Avenue (John Lennon’s childhood home).
					</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • St Peter’s Church Hall (Paul and John’s first
						meeting and
						where Paul auditioned for the Quarry Men).</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Elenor Rigby’s Grave.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Forthlin Road (Paul’s childhood home).</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Strawberry Fields.</p>

					<p>There is a break in the tour to go inside Strawberry Fields
						which is now open to the public. Opportunity to stop for
						refreshments.</p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Penny Lane.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Arnold Grove (George’s first House).</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Sefton Park (where John’s mum and dad met).
					</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Admiral Grove (Ringo’s childhood home and the
						pub which
						featured on his album cover for Sentimental Journey- please
						note
						we are unable to stop the bus here but there will be photo
						opportunities from the coach).</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • LIPA - (now famous as the performing arts
						college funded
						by
						Paul McCartney but originally George and Paul’s secondary
						school
						the Liverpool Institute).</p>
					<p class="bullets">• The Philharmonic Dining Rooms (when John was
						famous he
						often
						said the thing he most missed was being able to pop into the
						Phil for a pint).</p>
					<p class="bullets">• We’ll also take you past primary schools, clubs
						and
						dancehalls
						they played in the early days and local hangouts as our tour
						guide paints a picture of the Beatles’ Liverpool through
						their
						eyes.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Our last stop will be the Cavern Club and
						we’ll be just in
						time for the same lunchtime session that the boys played 292
						times.</p>

					<p> Free time to enjoy lunch and explore the Cavern Quarter
						either
						at leisure or with our ever ready tour guide.</p>

					<p> For the beginning of the afternoon we stay within Matthew
						Street
						visiting the Beatle’s favourite watering hole post Cavern
						session The Grapes and then onto the Magical Mystery Museum,
						home to the biggest collection of Beatles memorabilia in the
						world.</p>

					<p> From there our tour moves on foot to pass by the original
						site
						of the Liverpool Odeon where the premier of A Hard Day’s
						Night
						took place then pass Lime Street Station to the Adelphi
						Hotel
						(home to the annual Beatleweek Convention) to board our
						coach to
						move out of the city to West Derby.</p>

					<p class="bullets"> • The Casbah - West Derby.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Everyone has heard of the Cavern but the
						Beatles
						themselves
						argue that the Casbah was where it all really started.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • A home-made club in the basement of Pete
						Best’s family
						home
						has been astonishingly preserved. Your tour of this 1950’s
						coffee club will be conducted by Pete Best’s brother Roag
						(also
						owner of the Magical Mystery Museum), an insider who
						passionately shares his family’s story. Be prepared to see
						(and
						touch) original artwork by John, Paul and George and hear
						heart-warming stories of how the Casbah shaped the makings
						of
						the band.</p>

					<p> Free time in Liverpool before dinner in Blake’s Restaurant
						at
						The Hard Day’s Night Hotel.</p>

					<p> Day 1 has only just begun! After dinner, we’ll head to Bar 4
						for
						drinks (and maybe a cocktail or two). A resident musician
						will
						play acoustic sets to get you in the mood for our Day 1
						grand
						finale!</p>

					<p> Get ready to twist and shout!!! We’ll head back down into
						the
						Cavern Club just in time for Beatles Tribute Act (Made in
						Liverpool) to hit that famous stage.</p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Day 2</p>

					<p> Rise and Shine!</p>

					<p> We’ll meet you at the Jury’s Inn by the Albert Dock to whisk
						you
						back in time. We’ll revisit Menlove Avenue and Forthlin Road
						but
						this time we’ll go inside.
						Each property has its own custodian who literally lives and
						breathes their houses. The childhood homes have been
						lovingly
						restored by the National Trust with original and replica
						furnishings. This is the closest we have to a time machine!</p>

					<p> Straight from the living room where John and Paul wrote
						Please,
						Please Me we’ll take you back to the Albert Dock where
						you’ll
						have plenty of photography time at the Beatle’s Statues on
						Pier
						Wharf before walking to the Beatle Story Museum.</p>

					<p> Free time and lunch on the Albert Dock.</p>

					<p> Walking Tour of L1</p>

					<p> John was at Art College, Paul and George next door at the
						Liverpool Institute, there was something in the air, they
						felt
						something better was coming, an exciting time which we’ll
						lead
						through on foot, tracing the footsteps of the Beatles just
						before the world took them away from Liverpool!
						Tour Includes:</p>

					<p class="bullets"> • The Philly.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Gambier Terrace (John Lennon and Stuart
						Sutcliffe’s
						student
						flat).</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Falkener Street (Brian Epstein’s home which he
						gave to
						John
						and Cynthia when they first married).</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • The Jacaranda.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Blue Angel Club.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • NEMS.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Ye Olde Crack.</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • LIPA.</p>

					<p> Evening ride on the Ferry across the Mersey.</p>

					<p> We fell in love with this glorious city and the stories it
						tells
						we hope with this package we can share that magic with you!</p>

					<p> See the Swinging London itinerary. With dinner at Beso,
						Covent
						Garden (A favourite restaurant of the band during the 60’s,
						we’ll
						dine in the Private Beatles Dining Room)</p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Day 2</p>

					<p> Board the bus bright and early in St. John’s Wood as we
						prepare
						for
						our journey to Esher, Surrey.</p>

					<p> Esher - Kinfauns (George Harrison bought a bungalow here to
						share
						with his wife Pattie Boyd. They painted the exterior in
						psychedelic
						colours and lived there until the 70’s. Although the
						bungalow no
						longer exists there is a blue plaque on the residence that
						has
						replaced it)</p>

					<p> On to Weybridge, Surrey</p>

					<p> Weybridge -Sunny Heights (just 10 minutes down the road from
						George
						you’d have found Ringo’s first family home. Complete with
						its
						own
						pub, Ringo and his wife Maureen started their family in this
						very
						well to do neighbourhood and kept Sunny Heights right up to
						the
						1980’s. </p>

					<p> Weybridge - Kenwood (a short walk from Sunny Heights we come
						to
						the
						mock Tudor mansion that belonged to John and Cynthia Lennon.
						The
						house where most of the Sgt.Pepper album was written and
						where
						Cyn
						found Yoko Ono wearing nothing but a silk kimono!)</p>

					<p> Back on the coach to Ascot, Berkshire</p>

					<p> Ascot - Tittenhurst Park (John and Yoko bought this house
						from
						Peter
						Sellers, had it all painted white, lived in it, recorded
						Imagine
						in
						it and then sold it to Ringo. Ringo held onto this house
						until
						the
						late 1980’s when he sold it to Dubai’s ex president.</p>

					<p> Lunch and Free Time in Ascot.</p>

					<p> Onwards to our final destination of Henley-on-Thames.</p>

					<p> Henley-on-Thames - Friar Park (George moved into Friar Park
						in
						1970
						when the estate was in disrepair. He personally oversaw the
						refurbishment of the quirky, gothic pile restoring it to its
						former
						glory. It’s vast gardens were tended to by George and
						include
						Japanese gardens, underground lagoons and a replica of the
						Matterhorn. </p>

					<p> Henley-on-Thames - The Row Barge Inn. Time to check in to
						our
						lodgings for the night. The Row Barge is a stones throw from
						Friar
						Park’s gates and served as George’s local. George popped in
						so
						regularly for a pint that he has his own stool at the bar.
						The
						landlord will regal you with stories of late night lock-ins
						and
						private jamming sessions over dinner. </p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Day 3</p>

					<p> A few hours of free time to explore the Royal village (home
						to
						the
						Henley Regatta) before boarding the coach back to London
						where
						the
						tour comes to an end. </p>

					<p>There was nothing glamorous about their time in Germany. They
						played
						grimy clubs full of gangsters, pimps and drunken sailors.
						The
						girls
						they were chatting to between sets were prostitutes and
						their
						room
						was an old store cupboard behind in a blue movie theatre.
						The
						arduous 9 hour sets gave them grit and tightened them up as
						a
						band.
						The tough audiences demanded they be exciting and raw.
						Mixing
						with
						the Hamburg art students who had become fans of the band
						made
						them
						aware of the importance of their ‘look’ and their pushed
						back
						teddy
						boy hair started to fall forward in preparation for the mop

					<p> With our Hamburg tour we visit the St.Pauli district. Famous
						for
						its
						bright lights and partying we’ll show you round the former

						district sharing stories of the Beatle’s time there as we

					<p class="bullets"> • The Bambi Kino (the cinema where the

						were
						given a store
						room to sleep in)</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • The Kaiserkellar (after a 3 month
						residency at
						the
						Indra the
						Beatles were promoted to the Kaiserkellar. A bigger club but
						the
						conditions were just as poor as the previous gig. This is
						also
						where
						Rory Storm and the Hurricanes were already the resident
						band.
						Ringo
						Starr was the glamorous drummer for the Hurricanes, often
						sat in
						for
						Pete Best when he went awol, making this the first place
						that
						all
						four of the Beatles played together)</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Hamburg’s Seaman’s Mission (Ringo and the
						other
						Hurricanes used
						this as their digs)</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • The Reeperbahn</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Top 10 Club (at the time this was the club
						all
						the
						bands wanted to
						play at. The Beatles moved to the Top 10 in October 1960.
						Paul
						became the band’s bassist during their time playing this
						club)
					</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • The Star Club ("the toppermost of the
						poppermost!"
						Returning to
						Hamburg in April 1962, after a stint back in Liverpool, the
						Beatles
						were booked by the Star Club. A 2000 capacity club with
						better
						conditions. In Reeperbahn terms they had made it. They would
						come
						back for a 2nd residency in November 62 and this time they
						returned
						with Ringo as their drummer)</p>
					<p class="bullets"> • Hotel Germania (the band’s living
						conditions
						also
						improved once
						they were booked at the Star Club. Hotel Germania became
						their
						home
						during their stint in early 1962)</p>
					<p class="bullets"> Hotel Pacific (returning towards the end of
						62
						the
						Beatles were
						promoted to the Hotel Pacific. The beds behind a blue movie
						screen
						were becoming a distant memory)</p>

						and

					<p> Our tour will walk you through those heady days of January

						when
						the

						and
						we’ll
						show you around Lennon’s City. </p>

					<p> A one day tour by foot across the city including the
						following
						locations: </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Plaza Hotel (the Beatles took over an
						entire
						floor
						of this regal hotel
						in February 1964 and had to have a police cordon around the
						full
						perimeter of the building to stop the throng of screaming
						fans
						from
						besieging it. This was the Beatle’s first visit to the
						States).
					</p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Ed Sullivan Theatre (the Beatles’s
						appearance
						on
						the Ed Sullivan Show
						was filmed at this theatre. 73 million people tuned in to
						watch
						the
						4
						mop tops that evening. This is still believed to be the
						largest
						audience
						for a television program to date). </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Madison Square Gardens (John’s last ever
						performance was here when he
						appeared on stage for a duet with Elton John. The Beatles
						also
						broke
						records in the same stadium). </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • St Regis Hotel (This is the hotel that
						John
						and
						Yoko stayed in for
						their first few months in New York). </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • The Hit Factory (John was a regular
						visitor to
						the
						recording studios
						and recorded most of his solo albums here). </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Smiths Bar (Just a stroll from the Hit
						Factory
						this burger joint was a
						favourite late night spot for John). </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Bank Street (John and Yoko’s first home in
						the
						City). </p>

					<p class="bullets"> • The Dakota (The long term home for John
						and
						Yoko.
						This is also the
						place where John met his death. Yoko still lives here now).
					</p>

					<p class="bullets"> • Central Park, Strawberry Fields (Yoko’s

					<p> In February 1968 the Beatles travelled to India to study
						transcendental meditation
						under
						the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Joined by a host of celebrity
						pals &
						reporters the world
						looked on bewildered.</p>
					<p> Today the pictures and footage from that trip have
						become
						iconic. As Sgt. Pepper had
						turned a generation onto LSD the Beatles trip to India
						put
						that
						same generation on a
						different path.</p>
					<p> The band were inspired creatively by their time at the
						ashram,
						writing some of their
						most iconic songs during their stay and for George
						Harrison
						it
						would be the start of
						a
						spiritual journey that he spent the rest of his life
						travelling.
					</p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Day 1 - The Beatle’s Ashram</p>

					<p> The abandoned enclosure of bungalows and
						meditation domes no longer emit the luxury that they
						would
						have
						when
						the Beatles came to stay but the encroaching jungle and
						decaying
						shrines give an ambience of peace and tranquillity. The
						Maharishi’s
						decadent house still stands and the rooms that the
						Beatles
						slept
						and
						meditated in are open for visitors to peruse at their
						leisure.
						We’ll spend the day exploring this fascinating site.
						Locals
						and
						travellers alike gather daily with acoustic guitars
						strumming
						and
						singing the songs that the Beatles wrote during their
						time
						adding to
						the ambience of a time gone by.</p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Day 2 - The Shiva Temple</p>

					<p> A day tour through the Himalayas to this amazing temple.
						Stopping en
						route to see the hand washing ritual on the banks of the
						River
						Ganges we’ll take the same route that the Beatles took
						when
						they
						took a tour with the Maharishi.</p>

					<p class="paraSubs">Days 3-4 - Yoga and Meditation Retreat
					</p>
					<p> This beautiful hideaway in the holy Himalayas is built
						around
						the
						same teachings of the Maharishi that the Beatles were so
						eager
						to
						learn about back in 1968. This is the time to step out
						of
						modern
						life and immerse yourself in the simplicity of basic
						living.
						The
						ashram has a easy to follow programme of meditation and
						yoga
						as
						well
						as sitar lessons for those who really want to throw
						themselves
						into
						the George experience. All meals included.</p>

					<p class="paraSubs">This tour runs from February- April
						only.
