												<p class="paraSubs">Day 1</p>

												<p> Our day starts with a morning of sightseeing on our
													psychedelic
													tour bus. Coach based with stops for photo opportunities at
													all
													of the points of interest:</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Menlove Avenue (John Lennon’s childhood home).
												</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • St Peter’s Church Hall (Paul and John’s first
													meeting and
													where Paul auditioned for the Quarry Men).</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Elenor Rigby’s Grave.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Forthlin Road (Paul’s childhood home).</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Strawberry Fields.</p>

												<p>There is a break in the tour to go inside Strawberry Fields
													which is now open to the public. Opportunity to stop for
													refreshments.</p>

												<p class="bullets"> • Penny Lane.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Arnold Grove (George’s first House).</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Sefton Park (where John’s mum and dad met).
												</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Admiral Grove (Ringo’s childhood home and the
													pub which
													featured on his album cover for Sentimental Journey- please
													note
													we are unable to stop the bus here but there will be photo
													opportunities from the coach).</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • LIPA - (now famous as the performing arts
													college funded
													by
													Paul McCartney but originally George and Paul’s secondary
													school
													the Liverpool Institute).</p>
												<p class="bullets">• The Philharmonic Dining Rooms (when John was
													famous he
													often
													said the thing he most missed was being able to pop into the
													Phil for a pint).</p>
												<p class="bullets">• We’ll also take you past primary schools, clubs
													and
													dancehalls
													they played in the early days and local hangouts as our tour
													guide paints a picture of the Beatles’ Liverpool through
													their
													eyes.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Our last stop will be the Cavern Club and
													we’ll be just in
													time for the same lunchtime session that the boys played 292
													times.</p>

												<p> Free time to enjoy lunch and explore the Cavern Quarter
													either
													at leisure or with our ever ready tour guide.</p>

												<p> For the beginning of the afternoon we stay within Matthew
													Street
													visiting the Beatle’s favourite watering hole post Cavern
													session The Grapes and then onto the Magical Mystery Museum,
													home to the biggest collection of Beatles memorabilia in the
													world.</p>

												<p> From there our tour moves on foot to pass by the original
													site
													of the Liverpool Odeon where the premier of A Hard Day’s
													Night
													took place then pass Lime Street Station to the Adelphi
													Hotel
													(home to the annual Beatleweek Convention) to board our
													coach to
													move out of the city to West Derby.</p>

												<p class="bullets"> • The Casbah - West Derby.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Everyone has heard of the Cavern but the
													Beatles
													themselves
													argue that the Casbah was where it all really started.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • A home-made club in the basement of Pete
													Best’s family
													home
													has been astonishingly preserved. Your tour of this 1950’s
													coffee club will be conducted by Pete Best’s brother Roag
													(also
													owner of the Magical Mystery Museum), an insider who
													passionately shares his family’s story. Be prepared to see
													(and
													touch) original artwork by John, Paul and George and hear
													heart-warming stories of how the Casbah shaped the makings
													of
													the band.</p>

												<p> Free time in Liverpool before dinner in Blake’s Restaurant
													at
													The Hard Day’s Night Hotel.</p>

												<p> Day 1 has only just begun! After dinner, we’ll head to Bar 4
													for
													drinks (and maybe a cocktail or two). A resident musician
													will
													play acoustic sets to get you in the mood for our Day 1
													grand
													finale!</p>

												<p> Get ready to twist and shout!!! We’ll head back down into
													the
													Cavern Club just in time for Beatles Tribute Act (Made in
													Liverpool) to hit that famous stage.</p>

												<p class="paraSubs">Day 2</p>

												<p> Rise and Shine!</p>

												<p> We’ll meet you at the Jury’s Inn by the Albert Dock to whisk
													you
													back in time. We’ll revisit Menlove Avenue and Forthlin Road
													but
													this time we’ll go inside.
													Each property has its own custodian who literally lives and
													breathes their houses. The childhood homes have been
													lovingly
													restored by the National Trust with original and replica
													furnishings. This is the closest we have to a time machine!</p>

												<p> Straight from the living room where John and Paul wrote
													Please,
													Please Me we’ll take you back to the Albert Dock where
													you’ll
													have plenty of photography time at the Beatle’s Statues on
													Pier
													Wharf before walking to the Beatle Story Museum.</p>

												<p> Free time and lunch on the Albert Dock.</p>

												<p> Walking Tour of L1</p>

												<p> John was at Art College, Paul and George next door at the
													Liverpool Institute, there was something in the air, they
													felt
													something better was coming, an exciting time which we’ll
													lead
													through on foot, tracing the footsteps of the Beatles just
													before the world took them away from Liverpool!
													Tour Includes:</p>

												<p class="bullets"> • The Philly.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Gambier Terrace (John Lennon and Stuart
													Sutcliffe’s
													student
													flat).</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Falkener Street (Brian Epstein’s home which he
													gave to
													John
													and Cynthia when they first married).</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • The Jacaranda.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Blue Angel Club.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • NEMS.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • Ye Olde Crack.</p>
												<p class="bullets"> • LIPA.</p>

												<p> Evening ride on the Ferry across the Mersey.</p>

												<p> We fell in love with this glorious city and the stories it
													tells
													we hope with this package we can share that magic with you!</p>

												<p class="paraSubs">Day 1</p>

												<p> See the Swinging London itinerary. With dinner at Beso, Covent
													Garden (A favourite restaurant of the band during the 60’s, we’ll
													dine in the Private Beatles Dining Room)</p>

												<p class="paraSubs">Day 2</p>

												<p> Board the bus bright and early in St. John’s Wood as we prepare for
													our journey to Esher, Surrey.</p>

												<p> Esher - Kinfauns (George Harrison bought a bungalow here to share
													with his wife Pattie Boyd. They painted the exterior in psychedelic
													colours and lived there until the 70’s. Although the bungalow no
													longer exists there is a blue plaque on the residence that has
													replaced it)</p>

												<p> On to Weybridge, Surrey</p>

												<p> Weybridge -Sunny Heights (just 10 minutes down the road from George
													you’d have found Ringo’s first family home. Complete with its own
													pub, Ringo and his wife Maureen started their family in this very
													well to do neighbourhood and kept Sunny Heights right up to the
													1980’s. </p>

												<p> Weybridge - Kenwood (a short walk from Sunny Heights we come to the
													mock Tudor mansion that belonged to John and Cynthia Lennon. The
													house where most of the Sgt.Pepper album was written and where Cyn
													found Yoko Ono wearing nothing but a silk kimono!)</p>

												<p> Back on the coach to Ascot, Berkshire</p>

												<p> Ascot - Tittenhurst Park (John and Yoko bought this house from Peter
													Sellers, had it all painted white, lived in it, recorded Imagine in
													it and then sold it to Ringo. Ringo held onto this house until the
													late 1980’s when he sold it to Dubai’s ex president.</p>

												<p> Lunch and Free Time in Ascot.</p>

												<p> Onwards to our final destination of Henley-on-Thames.</p>

												<p> Henley-on-Thames - Friar Park (George moved into Friar Park in 1970
													when the estate was in disrepair. He personally oversaw the
													refurbishment of the quirky, gothic pile restoring it to its former
													glory. It’s vast gardens were tended to by George and include
													Japanese gardens, underground lagoons and a replica of the
													Matterhorn. </p>

												<p> Henley-on-Thames - The Row Barge Inn. Time to check in to our
													lodgings for the night. The Row Barge is a stones throw from Friar
													Park’s gates and served as George’s local. George popped in so
													regularly for a pint that he has his own stool at the bar. The
													landlord will regal you with stories of late night lock-ins and
													private jamming sessions over dinner. </p>

												<p class="paraSubs">Day 3</p>

												<p> A few hours of free time to explore the Royal village (home to the
													Henley Regatta) before boarding the coach back to London where the
													tour comes to an end. </p>
